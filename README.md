# EventBot - RPA League - Houston, Texas

Students stumbling into a large industry frequently seek out events to network and meet with industry professionals on sites like eventbrite and meetup. Sometimes these websites are not the easiest to navigate, and you find yourself missing key events and opportunities that you would have loved to be a part of. Now thatâ€™s in the past. Our automation takes in user input of the city, state, and search term, then imports the data to your calendar and emails you the spreadsheet.

## Installation

Go to the UiPath [UiPath - Community Edition](https://www.uipath.com/developers/community-edition) to install foobar.

## Usage

We utilized a web browser, going directly to the search query using variables in the url, data scraped the information into a csv in excel, formatted the information using regular expressions and a few simulated clicks, then imported the information into google calendar or sent to the users email based on their preference.
